## 🎯 **PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION**

Since the direct IP (193.233.161.161) serves the complete, beautiful casino portal perfectly, and the health endpoints are responding through Cloudflare, the issue is likely:

2. **Origin server not accepting proxy connections properly**
3. **Cloudflare edge caching the 521 error**

### **Enterprise Solution:**
Implement a professional Cloudflare configuration with:
- Proper SSL/TLS termination
- Origin health monitoring
