# Professional Cloudflare Management Report

## KEY FINDINGS:

1. **DNS Configuration Issue**: 
   - Both root and www records show `Proxied: False`
   - This means Cloudflare proxy is DISABLED
   - Explains why HTTPS fails (no Cloudflare SSL)
   - HTTP works directly to server

2. **Authentication Error**: 
   - Cloudflare API returned 403 Authentication error
   - Token may need additional permissions
   - Or rate limiting in effect

3. **HTTPS Connection Failures**:
   - Port 443 (HTTPS) connection refused
   - Server likely not configured for direct HTTPS
   - Needs Cloudflare proxy enabled for SSL

4. **HTTP Success**:
   - Both http://bestcasinoportal.com and http://www.bestcasinoportal.com return HTTP 200
   - Content length: 14963 bytes
   - Server is working, just needs proper SSL proxy

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. Enable Cloudflare Proxy for DNS records
2. Verify/update Cloudflare API token permissions  
3. Re-test after proxy enabled
